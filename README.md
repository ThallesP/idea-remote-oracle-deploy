<h1 align="center">Idea Remote Oracle Deploy</h1>

You want to use Oracle's free tier to launch a remote development server of IntelliJ IDEA but noticed that Jetbrains still doesn't support ARM? This is the script for you!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

```bash
# You should run this on the server and not on your machine
sudo apt-get install ansible # You'll need Ansible
git clone https://github.com/ThallesP/idea-remote-oracle-deploy
cd idea-remote-oracle-deploy
```

## üöÄ How to run the script

```bash
# You should run this on the server and not on your machine
ansible-playbook install-remote-dev.yaml
```

## ‚ú® How do I connect?
Open your favorite IDE, go to the remote development tab (normally is in the select project screen), create a new ssh connection, put your ssh credentials and hit login, then you can select your favorite IDE from the dropdown. 


# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

## ü§î Questions

### Can this script run on non-oracle machines?

It probably can, but I haven't tested it yet, you can give it a try and show us the results by opening an issue!
